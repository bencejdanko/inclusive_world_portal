# Impersonating Users

Impersonating users is the act of assuming control of someone's account. As an impersonator, you can act on the user's behalf to make the same scope of actions.

In order to impersonate a user, you must be logged into the [administrator access panel](/docs/user-guides/admin/access-panel/). 

Here are the steps:

1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Locate the "Users" resource and select "Change".
3. You will see rows for all available users. For the user you are interested in, select "Impersonate" under "Impersonate User".

You will automatically be logged in as the user, and will be able to take actions on their behalf.
